I received Ph.D. in Physics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with a Computational Science and Engineering concentration.
My main research interests involve the structure-property relationship of single plasmonic nanoparticles by developing machine learning/deep learning models and finite-different time-domain (FDTD) simulations.

Before UIUC, I received a B.S. degree in Physics from Ritsumeikan University and an M.S. degree in Applied Physics from Rice University.
